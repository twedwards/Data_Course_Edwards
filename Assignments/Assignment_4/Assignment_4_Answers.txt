1. read.csv() automatically reads in .csv files with the default delimiter being a comma (.csv stands for comma separated values). Also, read.csv will 
take the values and automatically put them in their respective columns and rows. 
2. read.csv2() is different from read.csv because it understands that a comma represents a decimal point, and a semi-colon as a field seperator.
3. read.csv2() exists because there are regions in the world that use commas in place of a decimal point, and a semi-colon as a field seperator.
4. In order to have read.csv read in that column of the file as a "character" class, you can use the colClasses() parameter to specify which column you want to change, 
and what class you want to change it to. I changed the command line to the following: df = read.csv("../../Data/landdata-states.csv", colClasses = c("State" = "character"))
5. summary(df$Home.Value)
6. Home.Value
7. By adding (...col=df$region) to the plotting code for the above plotting code separates the plotted points by region and shows the different regions in different colors
on the plotted graph.
